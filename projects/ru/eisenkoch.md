description: "Eisenkoch (from German “eisen” — iron, koch — chef) is a robotic plant for baking waffles. The compact 6-DOF UR3e manipulator, housed in a protected kitchen-case, is able to perform complex actions, from pouring the dough into baking tins to delivering the baked waffle to the customer. All the robot needs is a supply of dough and waffle sticks, then the robot performs the task autonomously. Eisenkoch greatly facilitates the work of baristas and is designed for installation in coffee shops."
